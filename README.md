# HR Attrition Analysis & Retention Strategy

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition data to uncover patterns and provide actionable insights to improve employee retention. Using Microsoft Excel, I cleaned, explored, and visualized HR data to identify the most common drivers of employee turnover.

The project simulates a real-world scenario where a company wants to reduce attrition rates and make data-informed HR decisions.
